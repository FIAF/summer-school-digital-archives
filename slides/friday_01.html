### **1. OAIS & PREMIS**

There are six defined responsibilities for a digital archive in OAIS. These steps should be actions any archive, analogue or digital, would consider important co complete:

>*1. Negotiate for and accept appropriate information from information producers*  

>*2. Obtain sufficient control of the information in order to meet long-term preservation objectives* 

>*3. Determine the scope of the archiveâ€™s user community* 

>*4. Ensure that the preserved information is independently understandable to the user community*  

>*5. Follow documented policies and procedures to ensure the information is preserved against all reasonable contingencies, and to enable dissemination of authenticated copies of the preserved information in its original form, or in a form traceable to the original* 

>*6. Make the preserved information available to the user community*

### **2. Code Resources**

Some places to go if you are interested in leaning more about Python or Bash.

Paul: 

- Matt Miller has a great series of videos on Programming for Cultural Heritage. They are a bit old but still great. 
https://videos.pfch.nyc/

- If you are looking for a "proper" Python course, I would highly recommend the executeprogram course:  
https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/python-for-programmers

- Ashley Blewer has an amazing blog around all things AV & Code:      
https://bits.ashleyblewer.com/

- Crash Course Computer Science is a good resource for "how does a computer work"
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo

### **2. Code resources**

- Python offer their own Beginners Guide with many tutorials, videos and interactive learning resources  
[https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)  

- Free Introduction to programming with Python provided by Harvard University, a great refresh and deeper dive into the fundamentals of Python  
[https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python)  

- A great podcast `Talk Python To Me` that chats to developers in different fields who write code or libraries for Python. Always uplifting and surprisingly informative, great for a regular commute or running companion  
[https://talkpython.fm/](https://talkpython.fm/)

- Corey Schafer's YouTube channel provides 200+ free Python instructional videos which provide guidance and comparisons to different features of Python and libraries
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g)

### **2. Code resources**

- FFmpeg Cookbook for Archivists by Reto Kromer. Provides lots of different encodings for many different scenarios, and also provides FFmpeg installation guides incase you need to do that again!
[https://avpres.net/FFmpeg/](https://avpres.net/FFmpeg/)

- Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry (COPTR) contains 610 open-source tools and 36 open-source workflows to help with digital preservation
[https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Main_Page](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Main_Page)

- Association of Moving Image Archivists (AMIA) Open Source Workflows contains a fairly extensive list of open-source goodies generated by global audiovisual archivists

### **3. How to Work With Other People's Code**

When you find some code you think is interesting, or may help with your own script development:

> 1. Read it like logs, from the bottom up! Find that one thing you understand about the code you're interested in, and track backward from those actions from the back forward

> 2. Chain together, in reverse, the steps the code takes to deliver that final desired result. This will help you understand someone else's workflow approach and in turn may shed light on your own decisions

> 3. Look for where key variables are defined, what functions are used when, where source assets are collected and how you may be able to sub in your own source assets if adapting the code for your usage

> 4. Get a test environment set up away from preservation workflows, install any dependencies needed (you're experts now!) and carefully change one thing at a time and note how that changes the outcome

> 5. Contact the developer who made them! We don't mind having questions asked. It's exciting to think someone is taking inspiration from existing workflows and we love talking about this stuff!

> 6. Be careful with your code choices, you can learn good and bad habits from code but exposing yourself to lots of code aligned to your needs will build you understanding of how to read/reuse other's hard work!

### **3. How to Work With Other People's Code**

Some interesting code repositories worth investigating:  

- [CUNY Television mediamicroservices](https://github.com/mediamicroservices/mm) - bash code with FFmpeg interactivity and Homebrew install guides

- [Blinken OSA workflows](https://github.com/BlinkenOSA/workflows) - AV preservation Python workflows in docker container

- [Carnegie Hall repository](https://github.com/CarnegieHall) including MediaConch QC scripts, metadata matching in Python and other languages

- [Puget Sound and Vision](https://github.com/pugetsoundandvision/audiotools) Bash scripts for audio preservation

- [AMI Tools from New York Public Library](https://github.com/NYPL/ami-tools/tree/main) Python scripts to help manage NYPL audio media files

- [BFIscripts](https://github.com/bfidatadigipres/BFI_scripts), [DPX Encoding](https://github.com/bfidatadigipres/dpx_encoding/tree/main/qnap_film) and [FFmpeg transcoding](https://github.com/bfidatadigipres/transcoding) - a combination of Python and Bash

### **6. FFmprovisor, FFmpeg Art School**

FFmprovisr is an excellent resource for useful AV opensource related commands.

https://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/

FFmpeg Art School shows how much fun you can have with FFmpeg!

### **7. LLM as code assistant**


Worth noting that when you are working with code you can also of course make use of LLMs. This can be to write an example code to study, explain how some code works, or ask questions about your own code.
